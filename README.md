# Amplifier & Distortion Pedal Project
My individual 3rd year project involved the design of a 9V guitar amplifier and a 3-stage overdrive/distortion/fuzz pedal, with each design being intended to be portable. Good circuit design, simulation and ECAD knowledge has been required in this project, as well as excellent circuit debugging skills.

The amplifier has maximum achievable gain of ~19dB, with the inclusion of a 3-band EQ system, allowing bass, middle and treble frequencies to be adjusted. Through using a large capacitor on the bass tone control and a small capacitor on the trble tone control, a shimmer effect similar to fender amplifiers was achieved (due to a small phase shift in the respective frequencies). This device has been successfully designed, simulated and constructed through to completion.

The designed disortion/fuzz pedal has a unique tone toggle switch, allowing for mid-range frequencies to be boosted/removed, with the frequency range being fruther adjustable using a potentiometer. Furthermore, both soft-clipping and hard-clipping can be engaged, to achieve fuzz-like sounds.
